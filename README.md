# Generalized-Synthetic-Image-Generator
Generates synthetic images in simulated 3D environments with configurable and varied lighting conditions, procedurally generated textures, randomly scattered objects, and skyboxes based on supplied images. Aims to make image-focused data science and machine learning more accessible without the need to manually and tediously compile large image datasets.
